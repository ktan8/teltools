# TelFuse

TelFuse is an approach to identify ectopic telomeric repeat sequences (i.e. telomeric repeat sequences in abnormal locations) from short-read data. Telomeric repeat sequences are typically found at the chromosomal ends. However, they can also be found in abnormal locations in the cancer genome, in either the standard orientation relative to a breakpoint (i.e. same as normal telomeres), or in the inverted orientation.
